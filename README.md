## Getting Started

### Installing via the installation script
The installation script requires `docker`, `wget`, `grep`, `jq` and `curl`

##### System-wide installation:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nixmember/nixmember/master/install.sh | sudo bash -s
```

**Note:** Always check bash scripts before running them as sudo. Feel free to check out our installation script, it's safe.

##### Local installation

```

### Compiling

In order to compile `nxm` you need to have `go` and `git` installed, and run the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nixmember/nixmember && cd nixmember

The binary will now build in the directory, you can move the binary to the `/usr/bin` directory by running the following command:

```bash
sudo mv nxm /usr/bin
```
or for local installation:

```bash
mkdir ~/.local/bin
mv nxm ~/.local/bin
